# VoiceNavi-with-drowsiness-detect-on-RPI3

Step 1: What do we need?
=======================
In this guide, we will be using:

  - Raspberry Pi 3
  - Official Raspberry Pi 3.5‚Äù Display
  - USB microphone
  - Speaker
  - PiCamera

Step 2: Setting Up Environment
=============================
For the sake of tidiness in system wide python library, we will be finishing this whole project within one virtual environment. The package management program we are using in this project is called "Berryconda", which is a Conda based distribution for the RPI3. To install Berryconda on RPI3, first download installer script according to the Raspberry Pi you are using from the website below and follow the steps:

https://github.com/jjhelmus/berryconda

```
$ chmod +x Berryconda3-2.0.0-Linux-armv7l.sh`
$ ./Berryconda3-2.0.0-Linux-armv7l.sh
```

After following the prompt and finish the installation, we are then creating a virtual environment called "navi" and going into the virtual environment.

```
$ conda create -n navi
$ conda install conda
$ source activate navi
```

For more information on how to use Conda, visit documentation website on https://conda.io/docs/

Step 3: Setting Up Hardware
==========================

In order to setup necessary hardwares mentioned in step1, we are going through some dependencies installing and configuration setting process. Insert the following code in RPI3 terminal:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get -y upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install python2-dev python3-dev
```

Enabling SPI and Camera interface used by PiCamera and changing source for speaker output: 

```
$ sudo raspi-config
```

  Step 3.1: Test out the PiCamera module
  --------------------------------------
  
  Before we run into the code, let do a quick check on whether camera is working properly.
  
  ```
  $ raspistill -o output.jpg
  ```

  Now you shoud see an "output.jpg" file in your current directory. Open and see it!
  
  Step 3.2: Test out the Speaker and Microphone
  ---------------------------------------------
  
  ```
  $ arecord -D plughw:1,0 -d 3 test.wav && aplay test.wav
  ```

Step 4: Setting Up Drowsiness detection
=======================================

In this section, we are going to build up drowsiness detection on RPI3. Before that, libraries required for executing related python script are OpenCV, dlib. The installation guidance for these libraries are described carefully below. Follow it step by step.

  Step 4.1: Install OpenCV3
  -------------------------
  First of all, expand your file system to make sure we are able to use full space in our SD card.
  ```
  $ sudo raspi-config
  ```
  ![Example](https://github.com/colinycw/VoiceNavi-with-drowsiness-detect-on-RPI3/blob/master/Expand%20File%20System.png "Expand file system")
  
  Next, we want to uninstall several applications that will not be used withing this project in order to free up some space.
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get remove --purge wolfram-engine libreoffice*
  $ sudo apt-get clean
  $ sudo apt-get autoremove
  ```
  
  We then need to install some developer tools which will help us on OpenCV installation process. This process is going to take some times, but don't get your coffee yet. I'll inform you later at the best timing to get it.
  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake pkg-config libjpeg-dev libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev libxvidcore-dev libx264-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libatlas-base-dev gfortran python2.7-dev python3-dev
  ```
  
  Now we have our dependencies installed, we will download and unzip OpenCV source codes for future execution.
  ```
  $ cd ~
  $ wget -O opencv.zip https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.3.0.zip
  $ wget -O opencv_contrib.zip https://github.com/Itseez/opencv_contrib/archive/3.3.0.zip
  $ unzip opencv.zip
  $ unzip opencv_contrib.zip
  ```
  
  Before compiling OpenCV source code, we have to install Numpy package and setup our build by typing:
  ```
  $ pip install numpy
  $ cd ~/opencv-3.3.0/
  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
  $ -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local \
  $ -D INSTALL_PYTHON_EXAMPLES=ON \
  $ -D OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH=~/opencv_contrib-3.3.0/modules \
  $ -D BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON ..
  ```
  
  Before we start the compiling process, we should increase our swap space size by changing CONF_SWAPSIZE value in /etc/dphys-swapfile from 100 (default) to 1024 and reactivate our configuration after modification. (Remember the change the value back after the installtion process.)
  ```
  $ # set size to absolute value, leaving empty (default) then uses computed value
  $ #   you most likely don't want this, unless you have an special disk situation
  $ CONF_SWAPSIZE=1024
  $ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop
  $ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start
  ```
  
  Here comes the compiling process! This will be a good time for you to grab some coffee and desserts cause this will takes a long long time.....................................(Probably 2 to 3 hours or more)
  ```
  $ make -j4
  ```
  
  Having a nice rest? From here, the last thing we need to do is install OpenCV on RPI3:
  ```
  $ sudo make install
  $ sudo ldconfig
  ```
  
  And finally, create a soft link OpenCV bindings from where your OpenCV is installed.
  ```
  sudo ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/cv2.so /home/pi/berryconda3/envs/navi/lib/python3.5/site-packages
  ```
  
  Step 4.2: Install dlib
  ----------------------
